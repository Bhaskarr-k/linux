Linux file system?
A Linux file system is a structured of files on a disk drive or a partiion.  A partition is a segment of memory and contais some specific data. in our machine there can be various partitions of the memory. generally every partition contains a file system.
the general purpose computer system needs to store data systematically so that we can easily access the files in lesst time. it stores the data hard disks or some equivalent storage type. there may be below reasons for maintaining the file system.
the linux file system containes the following sections.
    * the root directory(/)
    * a specofoc data storage format(EXT3, EXT4,BTRFS)
    * a partition or logical voulme having a particular file system.
directory structure:
the direcotries helip us to store the files and locate them when we need them. also directories are called folders as they can be assumed of as folders where files reside in the form of a physical desktop analogy. directories can be organized in a tree like hierarchy in linux and several other operating systems.
* / (root filesystem): It is the top-level filesystem directory. It must include every file needed to boot the Linux system before another filesystem is mounted. Every other filesystem is mounted on a well-defined and standard mount point because of the root filesystem directories after the system is started.
* /boot: It includes the static kernel and bootloader configuration and executable files needed to start a Linux computer.
* /bin: This directory includes user executable files.
* /dev: It includes the device file for all hardware devices connected to the system. These aren't device drivers; instead, they are files that indicate all devices on the system and provide access to these devices.
* /etc: It includes the local system configuration files for the host system.
* /lib: It includes shared library files that are needed to start the system.
* /home: The home directory storage is available for user files. All users have a subdirectory inside /home.
* /mnt: It is a temporary mount point for basic filesystems that can be used at the time when the administrator is working or repairing a filesystem.
* /media: A place for mounting external removable media devices like USB thumb drives that might be linked to the host.
* /opt: It contains optional files like vendor supplied application programs that must be placed here.
* /root: It's the home directory for a root user. Keep in mind that it's not the '/' (root) file system.
* /tmp: It is a temporary directory used by the OS and several programs for storing temporary files. Also, users may temporarily store files here. Remember that files may be removed without prior notice at any time in this directory.
* /sbin: These are system binary files. They are executables utilized for system administration.
* /usr: They are read-only and shareable files, including executable libraries and binaries, man files, and several documentation types.
* /var: Here, variable data files are saved. It can contain things such as MySQL, log files, other database files, email inboxes, web server data files, and much more.
